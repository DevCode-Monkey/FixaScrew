# FixaScrew :hammer_and_wrench:
Fix-a-Screw is a company that sells DIY products online and offers home delivery plus click and collect from local stores.  Customers can browse for products online and be shown if they are in stock or not.  In stock items can be placed in their shopping basket prior to them checking out.  A customer can checkout either as a guest or register for an account.  When checking out they can pay online and once an order is placed the customer is notified of when the item will be delivered or available for collection along with a PDF receipt via email.  The company has many customers and trade is brisk, however occasionally there can be sudden increases in trade, such as bank holidays or sunny weather.
